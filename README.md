# Redwood-University-database-system
the final project of csc423 database system
## two types of files are available:
1. jupyter note book.(you can see the running record in this notebook file)
2. python file.
## documentation
project part-1. Develop a conceptual data model reflecting the following requirements:

    a. Identify the main entity types.
    
    b. Identify the main relationship types between the entity types identified in "a".
    
    c. Determine the multiplicity constraints for each relationship identified in "b".
    
    d. Identify attributes and associate them with entity or relationship types.
    
    e. Determine candidate and primary key attributes for each (strong) entity type.
    
    f. Generate the E-R diagram for the conceptual level (no FKs as attributes).
    
project part-2. Develop a logical data model based on the following requirements:

    a. Derive relations from the conceptual model.
    
    b. Validate the logical model using normalization to 3NF.
    
    c. Validate the logical model against user transactions.
    
    d. Define integrity constraints:
    
    i. Primary key constraints.
    
    ii. Referential integrity/Foreign key constraints.
    
    iii. Alternate key constraints (if any).
    
    iv. General constraints (if any).
    
    e. Generate the E-R diagram for the logical level (contains FKs as attributes).
    
project part-3. Translate the logical data model for the Oracle Enterprise DBMS. 

    a. Develop SQL code to create the entire database schema, reflecting the constraints
    
    identified in previous steps.
    
    b. Create at least 5 tuples for each relation in your database.
    
    c. Develop 5 SQL queries using embedded SQL.
